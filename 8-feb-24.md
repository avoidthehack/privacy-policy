# avoidthehack Privacy Policy
This privacy policy was last updated: **8 FEB 2024** Previous versions of the privacy policy are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/avoidthehack/privacy-policy).

As a website that promotes end-user cybersecurity and privacy, avoidthehack! respects the privacy of all visitors. As a testament to this, this privacy policy will be short and easy to understand.

## Information collected
avoidthehack (which includes web properties owned by avoidthehack) uses [Umami for analytics](https://umami.is/), which is an open-source and privacy-friendly analytics software. It is GDPR and CCPA compliant.

Umami is self-hosted on cloud server infrastructure provided by Vultr, so the limited information it captures is only available for website administrator use. avoidthehack's instance of Umami collects:

* User-agent string
* The pages of this website (and only this website) that you visit
* Your browser's referrer header, _if_ one is sent. This is automatically anonymized so only the domain of the URL is collected, even if your browser offers the full string.

The Umami analytics software does not store cookies on your device or log IP addresses. If your browser happens to send a "do not track" (DNT) request to the avoidthehack website on your behalf, these requests are honored by default.

avoidthehack doesn't collect personally identifiable information without consent from the user.

## How avoidthehack uses your information
**avoidthehack! DOES NOT sell any personal information... because there's nothing to sell.**

The information avoidthehack collects via Umami is used to further improve avoidthehack for all visitors. Information collected is used to:

* Optimize this website for speed and ease-of-use
* Ensure site security from potential attackers
* Understand traffic volume (hits per page)
