This is a simple repo for housing the current and archived versions of the avoidthehack.com privacy policy.

It doesn't change often, but this is the new home for archived (and the current) versions of avoidthehack.com as of JAN 2024. Previously, only the current and most recent previous version were hosted directly on avoidthehack.com.

Now, avoidthehack.com will only feature the current privacy policy. Users who want to view archived versions of the avoidthehack.com privacy policy can do so using this repository.
