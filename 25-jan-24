# avoidthehack Privacy Policy
This privacy policy was last updated: **25 JAN 2024** Previous versions of the privacy policy are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/avoidthehack/privacy-policy).
​
As a website that promotes end-user cybersecurity and privacy, avoidthehack! respects the privacy of all visitors. As a testament to this, this privacy policy will be short and easy to understand.
​
## Information collected
avoidthehack (which includes web properties owned by avoidthehack) uses [Umami for analytics](https://umami.is/), which is an open-source and privacy-friendly analytics software. It is GDPR and CCPA compliant.
​
Umami is self-hosted on cloud server infrastructure provided by Vultr, so the limited information it captures is only available for website administrator use. avoidthehack's instance of Umami collects:
​
* User-agent string
* The pages of this website (and only this website) that you visit
* Your browser's referrer header, _if_ one is sent. This is automatically anonymized so only the domain of the URL is collected, even if your browser offers the full string.
​
The Umami analytics software does not store cookies on your device or log IP addresses. If your browser happens to send a "do not track" (DNT) request to the avoidthehack website on your behalf, these requests are honored by default.
​
avoidthehack doesn't collect personally identifiable information without consent.
​
## How avoidthehack uses your information
The information avoidthehack collects via Umami is used to further improve avoidthehack for all visitors. Information collected is used to:
​
* Optimize this website for speed and ease-of-use
* Ensure site security from potential attackers
* Understand traffic volume (hits per page)
​
If you reach out to the general inbox on the contact page, then your email address will be used to respond to your message.
​
Users wanting to remain anonymous when contacting avoidthehack are encouraged to use an alias or a temporary email address to do so. Also, you can reach out to us via social media.
